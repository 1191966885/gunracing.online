    <meta name="description" content="Draw Defense is a casual game to defend your castle by drawing lines with the mouse to crush waves of advancing enemies. Each line drops down to eliminate foes, challenging you to place them strategically before your defenses are breached. The simple controls and fast-paced gameplay make every move crucial as the onslaught intensifies. Combos add excitement, rewarding quick kills of three or more enemies with an ink refill to keep up the momentum. Upgrading your abilities is essential to survivalâ€”boost your ink bar&#39;s capacity and refill rate for more frequent attacks. These upgrades allow you to keep up with the growing enemy waves, adding depth to the action. As a final line of defense, your archer automatically fires arrows when enemies get close to the castle. Each enemy that reaches the castle costs you one of your three hearts, and losing them all means game over. Draw Defense tests your skill in balancing rapid drawing, timely upgrades, and last-ditch defenses in a thrilling fight for survival.">
